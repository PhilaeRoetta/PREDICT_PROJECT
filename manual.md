## Vocabulary<a name="vocabulary"></a>

Vocabulary used in the rules and in the software

- **season**: A season is a specific sport league during a year from a specific country (ex: The Elite league of basketball in France in 2024-2025)
- **competition**: A competition is a part of a season where rules are consistent (ex: Regular Season, or PlayOffs)
- **gameday**: A gameday is a set of games from a competition grouped together, where each team can play only once (ex: Gameday 3),usually designed by the sport league organization. Usually, all games of a gameday occur within the same time frame.
- **player**: A player is a forum user participating in the prediction game. Players must have a valid account on the forum, in order to post their predictions freely.
- **software administrator**: The person responsible for maintaining the software and the game.  
  This includes updating input files, adding competitions to the scope, checking player messages, and validating results.

## Prediction game rules<a name="gamerules"></a>
This part present the prediction games rules. It's a free game on forum with no rewards except recognition from other players.

### How to participate

Every gameday, players can make predictions on all games of the gameday, or a part of them, before their start time. Predictions posted after are ignored.

- Estimation of score difference

    Players predict the score difference (first team score - second team score, positive or negative) by copying this template, and replacing the '+1' with their prediction.
    ```
        #GameDayID.ForumGameID# Team1 vs Team2 ==> +1
    ```
    The template is part of the gameday prediction template, prealably automatically posted by the software thanks to the [planned calendar of run](#calendar).  
    An exemple (in French) can be found under GitHub directory: *file_exemples/forumoutput_inited_s2_13emejournee_france.txt*    
    Team1 is considered to be the home team, Team2 is considered to be the away team by the software, even if the game is played at neutral venue.

- Bonus game

    Players may select a bonus game amongst the one they predicted, by copying this template and replacing 'GameDayID.ForumGameID' with their choice.    
    ``` 
        #GameDayID.BN# Bonus game => GameDayID.ForumGameID
    ```
    The template is also part of the gameday prediction template, prealably posted by the software thanks to the [planned calendar of run](#calendar).    
    An exemple (in French) is available: *file_exemples/forumoutput_inited_s2_13emejournee_france.txt*  
    The bonus will awards players 3 times more points than a normal prediction

- Choice of a team for the prediction championship

    Before a defined deadline, players can choose and change their team for the prediction championship (see below), copying this template, and changing the chosen team.  
    ``` 
        SEASON.TM# Team for prediction championship => Chosen team
    ``` 
    The template is also part of the gameday prediction template, prealably posted by the software thanks to the [planned calendar of run](#calendar).    
    An exemple (in French): *file_exemples/forumoutput_inited_s2_13emejournee_france.txt*  
    The deadline is defined by the software administrator with the column SEASON_TEAMCHOICE_DEADLINE of [the input required manual file season.csv](#season)

### Individual competition

Players compete individually based on the number of points earned.

- "Good winner" score

    If players found the good winner, they get 15 points. Else 0.  
    Their score is multiplied by 3 if it is the bonus game.

- "Good score difference" score

    If players found the exact score difference they get 30 points. Else 15 points - the difference between the result and the prediction.  
    Their score is multiplied by 3 if it is the bonus game.

- "Automatic" score

    If players followed the template for their prediction they get 1 point.  
    If not, the software administrator have to insert manually the prediction in [the input required manual file correction_prediction.csv](#correctionprediction), and players receives 0 point.   
    Their score is multiplied by 3 if it is the bonus game.

- Gameday Number of points

    For each player, the gameday number of points is the sum of:
    - Good winner score  
    - Good score difference score  
    - Automatic score  
    
- Gameday individual ranking

    Players are ranked in descending order of their gameday number of points.

- Season individual ranking

    Players are ranked by the sum of their gameday points across the entire season. 
        
    Some KPI are included:  
    - Number of gameday with at least one prediction
    - Total number of predictions made
    - Number of gamedays where the player ranked first

- Average ranking

    The number of season point is divided by the number of prediction made.
    Players which made strictly more tham 50% of predictions in the season are ranked by the descending result

### Prediction championship

    Players can choose or change their team amongst predicted league teams, until a deadline fixed by the software administrator with the column SEASON_TEAMCHOICE_DEADLINE of [the input required manual file season.csv](#season). Their individual points contribute to the chosen team, for the prediction championship, until the end of the season, unless changed before the deadline.

- Games in the prediction championship

    During regular season, games are assumed to be the same than the ones of the predicted league.   
    This is decided by the software administrator with the column IS_SAME_FOR_PREDICTCHAMP of [the input required manual file competition.csv](#competition).  
    For other competitions, depending on the ranking of the prediction championship, their schedule might be different. For exemple for playoffs, the qualified TOP8 will probably be different than the one from the predicted league.
    In this case, the software administrator have to write manual prediction championship games in [the input required manual file predictchamp_game_to_add.csv](#predictchampgametoadd)

- Teams  points

    For each game:
    - A team’s score is the **maximum** gameday individual score among all players who selected that team.
    - The home team receives a **20% bonus**.
    - If the game is at a neutral venue, the administrator may disable the home advantage using **HAS_HOME_ADV** in  
    [predictchamp_game_to_add.csv](#predictchampgametoadd).

- Prediction championship game results:

    For each game of the prediction championship gameday, the team with most points win.   
    If tied, the home team win.  
    If home-away format deactivated, the first listed team wins (considered at home by the program).

- Prediction championship ranking

    A ranking between teams wins and losses is calculated.

### MVP election [Most Valuable Predictor]

For the last gameday of each month—or the last gameday of a competition—the program posts the results along with the total points earned during that period (both individual and team-based).  
Players vote for the MVP based on these results.

## Input tools and accounts<a name="inputtoolsaccounts"></a>

The software relies on several external tools, services, and accounts to operate correctly:
- **Snowflake account**, to store predictions and calculations, with at least one user having DML privileges (The software uses its credentials)
- **DropBox account**, containing some input files for a successful run, and some program files results in a stable tree
- **imgbb account** (https://imgbb.com/), to send results pictures online, in order to post them on forums
- **Gmail account** to send by email the status of the run<a name="emailsent"></a> (if ran through GitHub Actions), with details of run:
    - details from output need file, manually chosen with [the input file output_need_manual.csv](#outputneedmanual) or generated thanks to the [planned calendar of run](#calendar)
    - the next run timestamp from [the file next_run_time_utc.txt](#nextruntimeutc)
    - if applicable, the query to [check](#messageactioncheck) new messages from players  
    An exemple of the content of a mail can be found in *file_exemples/email_from_the_program.txt*
- **Sport season source accounts** for each season in the scope, a possible account to get games and result
- **Forum accounts** for each forum in the scope, a possible account to read players' predictions, and post prediction template and results

## Input Parameters<a name="inputparameters"></a>

The software uses a set of environment variables as input, provided as GitHub secrets:
- **SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME** and **SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD** to log in Snowflake account
- **RCLONE_CONFIG_BASE64**, Base64‑encoded rclone configuration used to authenticate to the Dropbox account.
- **IMGBB_API_KEY**, API key to log to imgbb account
- **GMAIL_USER** and **GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD**, email adress and password to send [automatic email on the status of run](#emailsent)
- **RECIPIENT_EMAIL**, comma-separated list of email adress for recipient of the [email automatically sent on the status of run](#emailsent)

Moreover, considering the [current scope](#currentscope), stored as GitHub actions:
- **LNB_URL** : the LNB website url
- **BI_URL**, the BI forum website, BI_USERNAME and BI_PASSWORD to log to BI acccount and post results

Considering the context of run:
- <a name="isoutputauto"></a>**IS_OUTPUT_AUTO** (0/1): If 1, the output_need file will be generated during run from the [planned calendar](#calendar). If 0, it uses the [output_need_manual file](#outputneedmanual), which can be [edited prealably by the software administrator](modifyingoutputneedmanual)
- **IS_TESTRUN** (0/1): If 1, the program runs in test environment. If 0 it runs in production environment

## Current scope<a name="currentscope"></a>
The software currently processes seasons from one source named "LNB" (French Elite basketball).  
These LNB seasons are handled through the module *get_game_details_lnb.py*, which retrieves game schedules, results, and competition metadata.

The software reads predictions and post templates and results on one forum, a PhpBB style forum named "BI" (French forum), with several topics (one for predictions per season, one for result per season).  
These BI topics are handled through the module *get_messages_details_bi.py*.  

At this stage, French is the only current supported language of the scope.  

The software administrator can [add more sources](#addtoscope)

## DropBox repository tree<a name="dropboxtree"></a>
To run successfully, the program requires some files and folders from DropBox, organized in a stable tree.  
This tree can be changed by modifying both [paths file](#pathsfile) and Python parameters in *config.py*

- <a name="nextruntimeutc"></a>**next_run_time_utc.txt**, in *current/outputs/python*: Store the next run time utc according to the [planned calendar](#calendar).   
When creating it must store the value "NONE". The calendar and its value will be updated after [adding new seasons and competitions in the scope](#addtoscope), according to new [planned calendar](#calendar)

## How to add competition to the scope<a name="addtoscope"></a>

The software administrator can add to the scope any sport season they want, for which games cannot end with a tie score; and link it to any forum they want, in any language:
- To prepare a new competition

    If the competition is on a new source, the software administrator must:
    - develop a Python module *get_game_details_xxx.py* with xxx being the source of the season.
    - add the module in the Python dictionary *game_info_functions* of the module *game_actions.py*, for it to be called
    - add URL of the source in GitHub secret to call it in the software [ -> See section Input parameters](#inputparameters)

    Then if the season doesn't exist yet, the software administrator must:
    - add the season to [the input required manual file season.csv](#season)

    Finally the software administrator must:  
    - add the new competition to [the input required manual file competition.csv](#competition) with possibly modifying other required manual files

- To link the competition with new topics

    If the topic is on a new forum, the software administrator must:
    - develop a Python module *get_messages_details_xxx.py* with xxx being the source of the forum.
    - add the module in the Python dictionary *messages_info_functions* of the module *message_actions.py*, for it to be called
    - add URL of the forum in GitHub secret to call it in the software [ -> See section Input parameters](#inputparameters)
    
    If the forum language is with a new language, the software administrator must:
    - add new files to DropBox: [output_gameday_init_template_xxxx.txt](#inittemplate) and [output_gameday_calculation_template_xxxx.txt](#calculationtemplate) with xxxx being the new language
    - add the new language to the json file *output_actions/output_actions_translations.json* by adding translations for messages parameters personalized during run

    Finally the software administrator must:  
    - add the new topics to [the input required manual file topic.csv](#topic) with possibly modifying other required manual files

- To add the new competition and topics to the database, the software administrator must:
    - run [the "Init compet" entry point](#initcompet)

## Calendar management<a name="calendar"></a>

The software can be run manually by the software administrator, using an [output_need_manual file](#outputneedmanual) that they prealably [modified](modifyingoutputneedmanual).  
But the software is also ran automatically, every 12 minutes, by GitHub using GitHub Actions, the file ouput_need being generated automatically. 
The automatic run of the software relies on the calendar management, to know what to run.

During the [main run](#mainrun) or ["Init compet" run](#initcompet), DBT performs DML operations on database.  
For each gameday of the season, the begin datetime of the first game, and the begin datetime of the last game is calculated.  

Considering it, the view *VW_CALENDAR* (see the file *vw_calendar.sql* for more details) enables the program to know when to perform tasks for the gameday (for more details of the definition of tasks see [here](#taskrun))
- TASK_RUN = 'UPDATEGAMES': planned several times before the first game of the gameday to detect possible changes of date and times of games in the predicted league
- TASK_RUN = 'INIT': planned at the beginning of the first game of the previous gameday - it will post the prediction template for the new gameday
- TASK_RUN = 'CHECK': planned at the beginning of each game, to read the latest predictions from players
- TASK_RUN = 'CALCULATE': planned two hours after the beginning of last game of the gameday, to perform and post calculations. If the last game is not finished, the extraction will return an error (see the module *get_game_details_lnb.py*), and wait for the next automatic run to retry again.

After updating the database without errors, the software will insert the ran task into [task_done.csv file](#taskdone), then compare the calendar of run to it, to get what utc time will be run next, and insert it into [next_run_time_utc.txt](nextruntimeutc).
    
Next automatic run by GitHub actions, at the very beginning of the run, the software will check if current utc time greater than the time from [next_run_time_utc.txt](nextruntimeutc).  
If it is not, it stops running, and [no email is sent](#emailsent). 
Else it continues, generating output_need related to the task from the calendar and downstreams.

- <a name="generateplayoffs"></a>Generate playoffs table: Creates a jpg graphical picture for prediction championship results, according to values in [the input file playoffs_table.txt](#playoffstable).  
The playoffs competition must exist in the database through the file [competition.csv](#competition). (see [here](#addtoscope) for adding it)
    - Can be run locally:  
        ```
            cd PYTHON_PREDICT
            python exe_playoffs_table.py
        ```
    - Can be run through GitHub actions through the workflow *gitrun_playoffs_table.py*

- <a name="mainrun"></a>Main run: Run the program on a daily basis, to read and post message, read games and calculate software results, based on the [planned calendar](#calendar)
    - Can be run locally:
        ```
            cd PYTHON_PREDICT
            python exe_main.py
        ```
    - Can be run through GitHub actions through different workflows:
        - *gitrun_main_auto_prod.yml*  
            Runs in production with output_need calculated automatically based on the [calendar of run](#calendar).  
                - Can be triggered manually through worflow_dispatch  
                - Scheduled to run automatically every 12 minutes  
        - *gitrun_main_manual_prod.yml*  
            Runs in production with output_need got from the file [output_need_manual.csv file](#outputneedmanual)
        - *gitrun_main_manual_test.yml*  
            Runs in test with output_need got from the file [output_need_manual.csv file](#outputneedmanual)

## Modifying output_need_manual file<a name="modifyingoutputneedmanual"></a>

The program runs tasks automatically based on [the planned calendar](#calendar). It can be overwrite by running a specific task with [the input file output_need_manual](#outputneed). Following is presented the different tasks processed by the software:

- <a name="gameaction"></a>GAME_ACTION
    - 'RUN': Will get games from the source with the specified GAMEDAY and update the database with details (date, time, results)
    - 'AVOID': Won't extract and update games details on the database

- <a name="messageaction"></a>MESSAGE_ACTION
    - <a name="messageactioncheck"></a>'CHECK': Will get messages from topics related with the SEASON_ID defined, from the utc datetime found in [the file message_check_ts.csv](#messagecheckts), update the database with predictions, but won't make calculation, so that the software administrator can validate them in the snowflake view *VW_MESSAGE_CHECKING*
    - 'RUN': Will get messages from topics related with the SEASON_ID defined, from the utc datetime indicated in message_check_ts.csv, until the beginning of the last game of the specified GAMEDAY
        - If there are messages, the task is converted into MESSAGE_ACTION = 'CHECK' and don't make calculation.
            The software administrator will have to validate them and change [the file message_check_ts.csv](#messagecheckts) in order to run calculations.  
            If ran automatically, the program will indefinitely convert the task until messages are validated
        - If there are no new messages (ie no messages not validated yet), it will perform calculations
    - 'AVOID': won't get messages

- <a name="taskrun"></a>TASK_RUN
    - 'INIT': Will initiate the defined GAMEDAY by posting the template of predictions on the forum
    - 'UPDATEGAMES': if combined with GAME_ACTION = 'RUN', will update details about games in the database, looking for possible change in date and time
    - 'CHECK': if associated with MESSAGE_ACTION = 'CHECK', retreives messages for the software administrator validation
    - 'CALCULATE': Post GAMEDAY results message

- <a name="istocalculate"></a>IS_TO_CALCULATE: If 1, will perform calculation on the database for the desired GAMEDAY if not already done.

- <a name="istodelete"></a>IS_TO_DELETE: If 1, will delete calculations on the database for the desired GAMEDAY (scores = 0)

- <a name="istorecalculate"></a>IS_TO_RECALCULATE: If 1, will recalculate by deleting and calculating again the desired GAMEDAY on the database
