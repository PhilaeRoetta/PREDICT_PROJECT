/* 
    The purpose of this table is to extract all competitions we focus on
    Inputs:
        landing_competition: we get all distinct seasons
    Joins:
        curated_season: foreign key
    Primary Key:
        COMPETITION_KEY based on SEASON_ID and COMPETITION_ID
    Foreign key:
        SEASON_KEY: 1-n relationship with season
        local_time seed to calculate UPDATED_AT_LOCAL
    Filter:
        landing_competition is already filtered on competition which should be processed
    Materialization:
        incremental to avoid removing old competition already in
