/* 
    The purpose of this table is to get all games:
    - from curated_game for competition which are the same for prediction championship
    - from landing_predictchamp_game_to_add for other competition
    Inputs:
        curated_game
        landing_predictchamp_game_to_add
    Joins:
        landing_gameday_modification: to know which gameday need to be renamed or grouped
        curated_competition: foreign key
        curated_gameday: foreign key
        curated_team: foreign key
    Primary Key:
        GAME_KEY: 
        - same than curated_game for game coming from there
        - or on PREDICTCHAMP_GAME_ID when coming from landing_predictchamp_game_to_add
    Secondary key:
        SEASON_KEY: 1-n relationship with season
        COMPETITION_KEY: 1-n relationship with competition
        GAMEDAY_KEY: 1-n relationship with gameday
        TEAM_HOME_KEY / TEAM_AWAY_KEY: 1-n relationship with team
    Filter:
        Inputs are filtered with game to process
        curated_competition: filter on IS_SAME_FOR_PREDICTCHAMP
    Materialization:
        incremental to avoid removing old games already in
